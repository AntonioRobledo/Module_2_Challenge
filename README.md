# My Technical Portfolio 

## Description

I have created and styled this portfolio as a way to display my web development projects that I am continuing to work on throughout this course. With time will come more and more impressive projects to add to my showcase. At the of the page I have added a functioning navigation bar for easier accessibility throughout the portfolio. In the section titled "Work" can be found links to different deployed applciations that I have created as well as brief title on the application as well as the languages and frameworks used to create the applications. At the bottom of the page can be found a variety ways to get in touch with me and also a way to visit my GitHub repositories.
